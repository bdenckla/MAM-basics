# Updates to the 2026-09-10 public-repository review

State: open, first entry 2026-09-12. Every entry here corrects or supplements
`doc/review-findings-2026-09-10.md`, which is left exactly as written.

Ben's decision, 2026-09-11: a finished dated document — a review, a remediation plan, a completed
plan, an execution record — is left as written. A correction or later disposition goes in a
sibling file named `<stem>-update.md`, which is what this file is for that review.

## Finding 9: the live plan no longer requires superseded FOI bytes

Recorded by Codex on 2026-09-12. This entry supersedes the review's statements that finding 9 is
unfixed and not acted on.

Commit `70d1f581` on branch `dual-agent-review-2026-09-10` fixes criterion 9 in the live
`doc/PLAN-silluq-before-gaya-template.md`. The criterion now compares the regenerated
`gh-pages/MAM-with-doc/foi/foi-mtgmtg.json` with the Git blob measured immediately before
implementation instead of requiring the superseded 718-record bytes.

The 2026-09-12 baseline at `f0795231` is blob
`b6c323992bb1d05e5995b1047449931c8e026464`: 717 records, with group counts 354, 228, 19, 102 and
14. The 1 Kings 7:37 record remains in `1/sopa-y/maq-n` and has two U+05BD marks. A later
starting-blob mismatch remains a finding to remeasure, not a reason to restore old bytes.

Product axis: the repair changes a live plan and this update record; it changes no generator or
product. Act axis: both writes are ordinary repository commits on the unpushed review branch; no
outward-facing act, destructive local act, external configuration write or receipt rewrite
occurred.
